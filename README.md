##Description


RunToScore is not just a running tracking app, it's also a game!

In addition to track your exercises (distance, time, speed, calories) RunToScore add medals on the map. Reach them to collect points!

The medals's position on the map are calculated to be placed on streets, so you can always reach them.

Within the next update you will be able to update your scores on Facebook and in the worldwide ranking to compare with others runners.

Start practice now, and have fun doing exercises :)
