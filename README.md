RunToScore
==========
_Windows Phone application_

RunToScore was a project made in 4 days to discover the C# language and the Windows Phone SDK.

The app is on the Windows Phone marketplace but need an update to continue working (because of a Bing Maps API change). The update is no planned.

##Description


RunToScore is not just a running tracking app, it's also a game!

In addition to track your exercises (distance, time, speed, calories) RunToScore add medals on the map. Reach them to collect points!

The medals's position on the map are calculated to be placed on streets, so you can always reach them.

Within the next update you will be able to update your scores on Facebook and in the worldwide ranking to compare with others runners.

Start practice now, and have fun doing exercises :)
